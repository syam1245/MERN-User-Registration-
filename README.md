**Description:**
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project for user registration. The project allows users to register by providing their name, email, password, and address through a React frontend, with form validation using the Yup library. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the backend is built using Node.js and Express. This repository serves as a practical example for developers looking to create a user registration system using the MERN stack.

**1. Project Overview:**
This project is a user registration system developed using the MERN stack. It includes both the frontend and backend components necessary to register users and store their information in a MongoDB database. The frontend is built with React and uses the Yup library for form validation. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express and connects to the MongoDB database.

**2. Setup and Installation:**
To run this project locally, follow the instructions in the README.md file.

**3. File Structure:**
- **server.js:** Entry point for the Node.js server.
- **app.js:** Express application setup.
- **routes/userRoutes.js:** Defines the API routes for user registration.
- **models/userModel.js:** Defines the Mongoose schema for user data.
- **controllers/userController.js:** Handles user registration logic.
- **config/config.env:** Configuration file for environment variables.
- **client/src:** Frontend React application.

**4. Running the Application:**
Follow the steps in the README.md file to run the frontend and backend components.

**5. API Endpoints:**
- **POST /api/v1/register:** Register a new user. Expects a JSON payload with name, email, password, and address fields.

**6. Frontend Validation:**
Yup is used for form validation on the frontend. The schema is defined in `client/src/App.js`.

**7. Database Configuration:**
The MongoDB database connection is configured in the `config/config.env` file. You need to set the appropriate MongoDB URI.
